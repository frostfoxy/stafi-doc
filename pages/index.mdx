# Introduction
 
Welcome to the StaFi Protocol documentation.

The StaFi Protocol is the first decentralized platform that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets. It aims to address the challenge of balancing mainnet security and token liquidity on PoS Consensus Blockchains. Through the use of staking contracts built on the StaFi Protocol, token holders can stake their assets and receive alternative tokens, called rTokens (rETH, rBNB, rATOM,etc), which are tradable ,transferable and applicable in DeFi while earning staking rewards from the original chain.

The name StaFi is derived from the combination of Staking and Finance. It is a decentralized protocol developed using the Substrate framework. The contract layer is composed of multiple staking contracts, while the application layer primarily serves as a trading platform for rTokens.

In summary, the StaFi Protocol is a powerful platform that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets, while also providing users with a range of benefits, including increased security and rewards of staked assets.
